# Introduction
The SDI Control Point GUI is a graphical user interface used to set up and control Iron SDI cameras.

The master-branch of this project contains the most recent GUI version used for our current line of products. Branches may be created for feature development and new device integration.

Development is done in the *dct_development* branch which will be pushed to the master when new features are ready. Other developers are encouraged to create their own branches and issue merge requests.

The software is based on the Qt framework and provided as a Qt-Project, which can be opened using the Qt Creator.

# Project Structure
The project contains four folders with multiple sub-directories:

* **application:** The Qt project file for the application as well as the main header, source and ui files  
* **dct_widgets:** A base class for custom widgets and sub-directories for each of widgets used in the application, as well as a dedicated Qt project to [build the widgets stand-alone](#import-custom-widgets-to-the-qt-designer)
* **libraries:** A collection of c libraries used throughout the project including [unit tests](#unit-tests-for-c-libraries)
* **ressource:** Ressources like images and icons used in the application

# Working on the Project
## Development Environment
The easiest way to edit the software is by using the Qt Creator, which is available for free for open source development at https://info.qt.io/download-qt-for-application-development    
It is recommended to use the latest version of Qt Creator and the Qt framework. The last tested version is Qt Creator 4.10.0 with Qt 5.13.0.

## Unit Tests for C-Libraries
The unit tests are written using an open source framework called embUnit which is available here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/embunit/  
At the moment the unit tests are not complete and outdated.

## Import Custom Widgets to the Qt Designer
**Note:** This step is only needed to make the widgets visible in the designer.

The application uses a lot of custom widgets which can be build as a stand-alone project. This is needed to add them to the widgets available in the Qt Designer. Please note that Qt ships with two kinds of Designers, the stand-alone Designer which is placed under

* Windows: ```C:\Qt\<Qt Version>\<Compiler Version>\bin\designer.exe```
* Linux: ```/opt/Qt/<Qt Version>/<Compiler Version>/bin/designer```

And the build-in designer of the Qt Creator. For more information see [this page](http://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/adding-plugins.html).

### Stand-Alone Designer
If you want to edit the widgets in the standalone designer, you only have to add an install step to your project by opening the "Projects" tab for the dct_widgets project and selecting "Add Build Step -> Make" and entering "install" as the "Make arguments". This will copy the needed plugin files to

* Windows: ```C:\Qt\<Qt Version>\<Compiler Version>\plugins\designer```
* Linux: ```/opt/Qt/<Qt Version>/<Compiler Version>/plugins/designer``` (you might have to grant yourself write access to this folder)

whenever a build is started.

### Integrated Designer
The integrated Designer of the Qt Creator fetches its plugins from

* Windows: ```C:\Qt\Tools\QtCreator\bin\plugins\designer```
* Linux: ```/opt/Qt/Tools/QtCreator/lib/Qt/plugins/designer``` (you might have to grant yourself write access to this folder)

To make the plugins available in the integrated designer, the files need to be copied there. At the moment this does not work under Windows, because the compiler versions of the Designer and the Plugins do not match (see [here](http://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/adding-plugins.html#matching-build-keys) for more details). On Linux you can use another custom build step to copy the files. Therefore open the projects tab in Qt Creator, select the "dct_widgets" project from the dropdown menu and klick "Add Build Step -> Custom Process Step". An example for the copy command under Linux would be:

>**Command:** cp  
>**Arguments:** libdct_widgets.so /opt/Qt/Tools/QtCreator/lib/Qt/plugins/designer/libdct_widgets.so  
>**Working directory:** %{buildDir}

You might have to restart the Qt Creator to access the new plugins from the Designer.

## Open the Project
Open the application project file "application.pro" in the "application" folder using the "Open Project" dialog from the Qt Designers welcome tab. After configuring the project with the kit needed by your operating system (MinGW 5.3 for Windows, GCC for Linux) open the "Project" tab for the "application" project and open the "Build" settings. Click "Add Build Step", select "Make" and enter "install" as the "Make arguments". This will ensure that additional files placed in the "application/tools_and_condigs" folder which are needed to run the software are copied to the build folder during the build process. Keep in mind that you will have to add this additional build step for every build target separately (e.g. release and debug).

To test whether the import of the custom widgets to the designer has worked, open "mainwindow.ui" in the "Forms" folder. If you see the groups "DCT Basic Widgets" and "DCT Dialog Widgets" in the widget list on the left side of the designer window, the import was successful. You can now start making changes to the software. Please note that you directly edit the widgets from the "application" project, you do not need to use the "dct_widgets" project. As noted above, recompiling the "dct_widgets" project is only needed to add new widgets to the designer.

## Deploy the project on Windows
By default Qt uses dynamic linking, that means all DLLs needed by the application have to be provided with it. To conveniently create a deploy folder that includes the application and DLLs run the script ```<project folder>\application\deploy_qt5.9.1_mingw5.3_win32.bat```. It will copy all needed files to ```<project folder>\application\deploy```.

If you want to use static linking instead (only one executable, no DLLs needed), please take a look at the [steps provided by Qt](https://wiki.qt.io/Building_a_static_Qt_for_Windows_using_MinGW).

## Deploy the project on Linux
For deployment on Linux see [this page of the Qt Wiki](https://wiki.qt.io/Deploying_a_Qt5_Application_Linux). The easiest way is again dynamic linking:

* Download the deployment tool app-image from [here](https://github.com/probonopd/linuxdeployqt/releases)
* Copy the deployment tool and your compiled "ProVideo" application file to a new folder
* Add qmake to the PATH variable, e.g.: ```export PATH=/opt/Qt/5.10.0/gcc_64/bin/:$PATH```
* Run the deployment tool: ```./linuxdeployqt-continuous-x86_64.AppImage ProVideo```
* The tool will copy all files needed to run the application into the folder

## Cross-Compilation under Linux
It is possible to cross-compile a 32 Bit windows executable under Linux by using the M cross environment (MXE).

How to crosscompile a QT5 project using MXE:

1. Get the MXE repo from github:  
   ```# git clone https://github.com/mxe/mxe.git```
2. Build the cross compile toolchain for qt5. The follwoing command will just build the needed functionality for this project to decrease compile time. To further speed up the process you can add "-j 4 JOBS=2" or something similar (see https://mxe.cc/#usage for more information):  
   ```# cd mxe && make qtbase qtserialport```
3. Go to the application folder of the project (where the application *.pro file lies)  
   ```# cd <project folder>/application/```
4. Add the MXE path to the path variable:  
   ```# export PATH=<mxe root>/usr/bin:$PATH```
5. Run qmake from the MXE toolchain to create the Makefile  
   ```# <mxe root>/usr/i686-w64-mingw32.static/qt5/bin/qmake```
6. Build the application:  
   ```# make```
7. The resulting executable will be placed in ```<project folder>/application/release/ProVideo.exe```. If you want to deploy the executable, do not forget to place the files from the folder ```<project folder>/application/tools_and_configs/``` in a folder named ```tools_and_configs``` in the same folder as the executable, otherwise firmware updates will not be possible and some configs will be missing.

The above steps will build a Win32 static executable. To use dynamic libraries or generate a 64 bit executable you have to use a different MXE_TARGET in step 2:

* MinGW-w64, 32-bit, static libs: ```# make qtbase qtserialport MXE_TARGETS=i686-w64-mingw32.static``` (default)
* MinGW-w64, 32-bit, shared libs: ```# make qtbase qtserialport MXE_TARGETS=i686-w64-mingw32.shared```
* MinGW-w64, 64-bit, static libs: ```# make qtbase qtserialport MXE_TARGETS=x86_64-w64-mingw32.static```
* MinGW-w64, 64-bit, shared libs: ```# make qtbase qtserialport MXE_TARGETS=x86_64-w64-mingw32.shared```

And use the according toolchain-path in step 5.

By default MXE currently uses GCC 5, if you want to use a newer GCC Version, e.g. GCC 9 add the following string to the make command from step 2:  
```MXE_PLUGIN_DIRS='plugins/gcc9'```  

A complete example building MXE with 8 threads and GCC 9 would look like this:  
```# make -j 8 qtbase qtserialport MXE_PLUGIN_DIRS='plugins/gcc9'```
